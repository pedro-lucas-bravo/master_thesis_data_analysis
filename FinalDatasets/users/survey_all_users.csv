It felt like interacting with another participant in the music and the overall aesthetic was really good. The only thing was that I sometime had problems 'clicking' on a sphere to return it but otherwise it was a really good system which I can see a lot of potential to to create music  and explore with.

If I could have used this interface with my own hardware (synths, guitars and other), it would have been easier to create an astonishing piece of art. I would prefer to be able to control whether I`d have a metronome or not, and the looper should not be dependent on following it (i.e. it should not have to wait for the first beat to play back and such, but things like that should be an easy fix in future versions). The lenses are a bit heavy on my head, but after a while I almost forgot. It would also be great to have a mixer controlling all eight tracks also when released, for faster adjusting of sound rather than having to catch the sphere again. But all in all a really fun and enjoiable experience."

Due to how the machine changed how each sphere played what I had put in when I released them, I can't say I would use it much to create music tracks for listening purposes.
